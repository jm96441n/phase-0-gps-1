1. What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

  I did not understand the difference between fetch and merge but Lorena and John were really awesome at not only explaining but exhibiting it as well.

2. What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

  Fetch and merge.  Fetch can update but does not merge.  If you want to merge, you can do so and fix mistakes if any occur.  This is after changes have been committed.

3. What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

  I asked mainly about fetch and merge and if I was doing it correctly when I was running the commands after committing changes.

4. What still confuses you about git?

  I don't think git is as confusing as it was before but I do have doubts in my mind sometimes when I'm going to the end of my pushing process to remote and hoping I did the entire process correct.  I'd like to test the differences between git pull and git fetch & merge.

5. How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

  I actually really enjoyed it!  I felt like having two heads than one was definitely better.  For example, when I became confused with the instructions about the fixing the merge conflicts, John was able to explain what was going on and what would be deleted/fixed.
