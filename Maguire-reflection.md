1) What git conceptswere you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
I honestly felt like I had a pretty good grasp of the git concepts we've been working with going into this GPS session, but this was great practice.

2) What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
The difference between fetch and merge was clarified.

3) What questions did you ask your pair and guide?
I did not really have any questions concerning git going into the GPS, so I didn't really have any questions to ask.

4) What still confuses you about git?
Git seems pretty straightforward. I gues the only thing I would be curious about is reverting from your current version of code to a previously comitted version.

5) How was your first experience of pairing in GPS?
It was a great first experience for my GPS. My guide and partner were great to work with, and gave some really positive and useful feedback.
